## üîê Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. We've provided a `.env.example` file that lists all the required environment variables with placeholder values.

To set up your environment:

1. Copy the example file to create your local environment file
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` to add your actual values

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file or any other files containing actual environment values. They are listed in `.gitignore` for a reason.

## üë• Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone! Here's how you can help:

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

Before working on anything, check if an issue already exists. If not, create one to discuss the changes you'd like to make.

**Important Note:** This repository is for frontend-related issues only. Please do not create issues related to backend functionality here. Frontend issues include UI components, styling, client-side functionality, and frontend performance optimizations.

### 2. Issue Assignment

1. Find an issue you'd like to work on
2. Comment on the issue expressing your interest
3. Wait for a maintainer to assign the issue to you
4. **Only begin working on the issue after it has been officially assigned to you**

This helps prevent multiple people from working on the same issue simultaneously.

### 3. Branch Naming Convention

Create a branch with a descriptive name following this pattern:
```
<type>/<short-description>
```

Types include:
- `feature`: New functionality
- `bugfix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or improving tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Example: `feature/user-authentication`

### 4. Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a structured commit message format to maintain a clean git history. Each commit message should be structured as:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

#### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- `perf`: Performance improvements

#### Example Commit Messages:
- `feat(auth): implement user login flow`
- `fix(ui): correct button alignment in sidebar`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
